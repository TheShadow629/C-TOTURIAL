There are two data files provided in data. You need to keep the files
in data.

Use "data/MetData-31-3.csv" first. 

Once you have got your program working, use the larger .csv data file. 
This larger file is for assignment 1. Assignment 1 should also work 
with the smaller data file.

Program uses only 1 file. 

The Vector class creates heap memory. A number of methods become mandatory because heap memory is being created. What are these methods? See Lec-13.ppt.

Nesting and templates has code example to show further usage of
templates as well as how to access data from nested classes.
The data is always accessed via a public get method. 
Use the debugger to single-step through each line of code
to trace the sequence of calls made. 

Is the Law of Demeter violated in the Nesting and templates code?
