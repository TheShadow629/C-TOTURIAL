You must complete all previous Sessions (topics 1 - 6) before starting on this Topic.

Any lack of preparation in the early stages is going to make it difficult for you in the later parts of the unit/module.

You need to complete assignment 1 first.

With the content and practical work for this topic, you start preparation for assignment 2. This advice is also applicable for the later lab topics.

****If you do not start preparation for assignment 2 immediately after assignment 1 submission, you will get stuck when assignment 2 is released. So the lab work for this topic 7 must be completed.

Without the preparation, you will not have time to complete assignment 2. Assignment 2 is worth more than assignment 1.****



Step 1: 
Read the textbook chapters - In a number of cases, you are being 
asked to read a particular chapter more than once because they are 
important. If you have already understood the chapter, you can skip.

o   Chapters on Standard Template Library, sections on Associative containers relating to set and multiset, container Adapters. We need the STL map data structure as well, but it doesn't have decent coverage in the textbook. The PowerPoint notes and reference are sufficient for map.

o   Chapter on Stacks and Queues, entire section on Stacks

o   Chapter 1 "The Object Oriented Paradigm" of the ebook "Design Patterns Explained" by Shalloway 	and Trott (in our elibrary).
	Go to http://library.murdoch.edu.au/, and enter "Design Patterns Explained" in the search box. 
	
o   Chapter 1 "Welcome to Design Patterns" of the ebook "Head First Design Patterns : A Brain-Friendly Guide" by Freeman, Eric, et al. (in our elibrary http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/murdoch/detail.action?docID=540877).
	Go to http://library.murdoch.edu.au/, and enter "Head First Design Patterns : A Brain-Friendly Guide" in the search box. 

These concepts are applicable now and till you retire from your software development career.

Step 2:
Go through any of Bucky's tutorials that you have not completed
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAE85DE8440AA6B83


Use codeblocks and do the tutorials instead of just watching the video.

In a number of cases, you are being asked to view and do the tutorial 
more than once. If you have already understood, you can skip the 
particular video tutorial.

Note that things are getting a little complicated. So if you have 
skipped any work from before, go back and complete.



Step 3:
Go through the 3 PowerPoint files in Content.

The map data structure is used in the lab work. Use the lecture notes.
multimaps can also be used in this unit when map is asked for.



Step 4:
Start on LabExcTopic07 (lab 7)in the Practical Folder as this lab serves as preparation for assignment 2. 

You will note that you are being asked to complete assignment 1 ASAP.

Then start on the exercises listed lab 7.


Be mindful of the advice given in the lab document.

Once you have completed the above, you are ready for the next topic.

If you have not understood something, make note of it to discuss during the class.
