Complete Topic 8 if not already completed.

Question 4 of Lab 8 must be completed to continue with this topic.


Step 1:
Go through any of Bucky's tutorials that you didn't complete
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAE85DE8440AA6B83


Use codeblocks and do the tutorials instead of just watching the video.

In a number of cases, you are being asked to view and do the tutorial more than once. If you have already understood, you can skip the particular video tutorial.

Note that things are getting a little complicated. So if you have skipped any work from before, go back and complete.


Step 2:
Read the textbook chapter. See my unit readings in the library for the ebook.

o  Chapter on Binary Trees



Step 3:
Go through the Content MS PowerPoint files. Pay attention to the BST powerpoint (Lec-29) and traversal algorithms in Lec-29 file for the practical work. 

The Lec-29 file is for trees in general. 

The Lec-30 file is for multiway (more than 2 nodes per parent node) trees.

In the lab/assignment, you would normally be asked to provide a rational for your data structures. In this video for BST justification one particular example is used.

In the video, the tree algorithm is modified to cater for a new requirement. This approach is not acceptable â€“ see Open Closed Principle. Think of a better solution. Other than that, the video explains the BST and its use very **well**.


Step 4:
Start on  LabExcTopic09-ass in the Practical Folder. This lab is assessed by your tutor during a personal demonstration/defence. Follow the instructions given in the lab exercise. 

This lab is preparation for assignment 2, complete it ASAP. 

Be mindful of the advice given in the lab document. It is preparation for the project/assignment 2.

You need to know the pros/cons of iterative vs recursive approaches by actual experience with these algorithms.

Once you have completed the above, you are ready for the next topic.

If you have not understood something, make note of it to discuss during the workshop/clinic/lab where you meet the lecturer/tutor.
