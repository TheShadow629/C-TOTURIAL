//Here's an implementation of the binary search algorithm as a subroutine in C++, using an ordered vector of `Date` objects:

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include "Vector.h"
#include "Date.h"

template <typename T>
int binarySearch(const Vector<T>&collection, const T & target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = collection.size() - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

        if (collection[mid] == target) {
            return mid;
        }
        else if (collection[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
        else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return -1; // Element not found
}

int main() {
    Vector<Date> collection;
    collection.push_back(Date(2022, 1, 1));
    collection.push_back(Date(2022, 2, 1));
    collection.push_back(Date(2022, 3, 1));
    collection.push_back(Date(2022, 4, 1));
    collection.push_back(Date(2022, 5, 1));

    Date target(2022, 3, 1);

    int index = binarySearch(collection, target);

    if (index != -1) {
        std::cout << "Element " << target << " found at index " << index << std::endl;
    }
    else {
        std::cout << "Element " << target << " not found in the collection" << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

//In this example, the `binarySearch` function performs a binary search on an ordered vector `collection` for a target `Date` object `target`. It returns the index of the target element if found, or -1 if the element is not present in the collection.The algorithm repeatedly divides the search space by comparing the target element with the middle element of the current range and adjusts the left and right bounds accordingly.

//Note that the implementation assumes the existence of a `Vector` class and a `Date` class, which you should have created as part of the labs and assignments.
