//Certainly! Here's a test plan for each of the set operations:
//
//1. Insertion:
//   - Test Case 1: Inserting a new element into an empty set.
//     - Create an empty set.
//     - Insert a new element into the set.
//     - Verify that the set contains the inserted element.
//     
//   - Test Case 2: Inserting an existing element into a set.
//     - Create a set with some elements.
//     - Insert an existing element into the set.
//     - Verify that the set remains unchanged and still contains the original elements only.
//
//2. Deletion:
//   - Test Case 1: Deleting an existing element from a set.
//     - Create a set with some elements.
//     - Delete an existing element from the set.
//     - Verify that the set no longer contains the deleted element.
//     
//   - Test Case 2: Deleting a non-existing element from a set.
//     - Create a set with some elements.
//     - Delete a non-existing element from the set.
//     - Verify that the set remains unchanged and contains the same elements.
//
//3. Membership Test:
//   - Test Case 1: Testing membership of an existing element in a set.
//     - Create a set with some elements.
//     - Perform a membership test on an existing element in the set.
//     - Verify that the membership test returns true.
//     
//   - Test Case 2: Testing membership of a non-existing element in a set.
//     - Create a set with some elements.
//     - Perform a membership test on a non-existing element in the set.
//     - Verify that the membership test returns false.
//
//4. Union:
//   - Test Case 1: Union of two non-empty sets with no common elements.
//     - Create two sets with different elements.
//     - Perform the union operation on the two sets.
//     - Verify that the resulting set contains all elements from both sets.
//     
//   - Test Case 2: Union of two sets with common elements.
//     - Create two sets with some common elements.
//     - Perform the union operation on the two sets.
//     - Verify that the resulting set contains all unique elements from both sets.
//
//5. Intersection:
//   - Test Case 1: Intersection of two non-empty sets with common elements.
//     - Create two sets with some common elements.
//     - Perform the intersection operation on the two sets.
//     - Verify that the resulting set contains only the common elements.
//     
//   - Test Case 2: Intersection of two sets with no common elements.
//     - Create two sets with different elements.
//     - Perform the intersection operation on the two sets.
//     - Verify that the resulting set is empty.
//
//6. Difference:
//   - Test Case 1: Difference of two non-empty sets.
//     - Create two sets with some elements.
//     - Perform the difference operation on the two sets.
//     - Verify that the resulting set contains elements that exist in the first set but not in the second set.
//     
//   - Test Case 2: Difference of two sets with common elements.
//     - Create two sets with some common elements.
//     - Perform the difference operation on the two sets.
//     - Verify that the resulting set contains only the elements that exist in the first set but not in the second set.
//
//These test cases cover different scenarios for each set operation, ensuring that they function correctly and handle various input cases effectively.
