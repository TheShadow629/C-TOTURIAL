You would have encountered some of the material in this set of slides
in your earlier units. 

Arrays are part of the revision exercise and need to be completed as we build on this prerequisite knowledge.

We are using C++ but concepts would be the same in the Computer 
Systems unit and the Foundations of Programming units.

You need to complete topics 1 and 2 before starting on this 
Topic as this topic makes use of the previous ones.

Any lack of preparation in the early stages is going to cause
severe problems in the later parts of the unit.

The revision exercise from the previous lab must be submitted.

Note that things will be getting a little complicated and you can see that in array coverage. So if you have skipped any work from before, go back and complete.



Step 1: 
Complete topics 1 and 2 if not already completed. The revision exercise 
has to be completed and submitted.

Read the textbook chapters -
- Chapters on Arrays, Strings and Records

- Chapter on User-Defined Simple Data Types, Namespaces, and the string Type

- Chapter on Standard Template Library (STL)



Step 2:
For Topic 3, go through the following from of Bucky's tutorial. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvC1WCdV1XU&list=PLAE85DE8440AA6B83
32 to 37, 
64 - 68, 
71 - 72 (for std::string needed later)

Use codeblocks and do the tutorials instead of just watching the video.


Step 3:
Go through the 3 powerpoint files in Content.

For this week's lab, Lec-07 and Lec-08 is relevant. 
Lec-09 is preparation for the next topic, and is found in the Homework folder. You will need the getline function for std::string in Lab 4. See Lec-09.



Step 4:
Complete Exercises 1 to 7 from LabExcTopic03 in the Practical Folder.
Start at Exercise 1 and work through systematically. 

When working on the registration code, use a debugger and single-step
through the code to see how the calls are made. Activate the call stack
and watch windows of the debugger.

Be mindful of the advice given in the lab document.

Once you have completed the above, you are ready for the next topic.
