This are samples of testing from final year IT project units. The current unit code is ict302 but in the past, there were other unit codes for the final year project unit. All IT students are required to complete the final project unit.

Bear in mind that these are final year projects and ict283 is only a 1st semester in the 2nd year unit. So that is more than a year to go before you are expected to reach that capability when **everyone** has to attempt the final project unit ict302. But you need start somewhere and start early.

For ict283, please do not go "over the top". See topic04 lecture 12. Application test Example is also given in Lec-23-TestData.xls

Sub-folders indicate the type of team members in the team. Students from all majors are expected to produce these test plans and testing documents.
