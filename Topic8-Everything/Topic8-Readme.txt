Complete Topic 7 if not already completed then go through the PowerPoint files in Content. 

Assignment 1 should be submitted.

Step 1:
Go through any of Bucky's tutorials that you didn't complete

Use codeblocks and do the tutorials instead of just watching the video.

In a number of cases, you are being asked to view and do the tutorial more than once. If you have already understood, you can skip the particular video tutorial.

Note that things are getting a little complicated. So if you have skipped any work from before, go back and complete.


Step 2:
Read the textbook chapters - In a number of cases, you are being asked to read a particular chapter more than once because they are important. If you have already understood the chapter, you can skip.

o  Chapter on Stacks and Queues, entire section on Queues, section on Application of Stacks: Postfix Expressions Calculator


Step 3:

Go through the PowerPoint notes and other material in the Content folder.


Step 4:
Start on LabExcTopic08 in the Practical Folder. 

Be mindful of the advice given in the lab document. It is preparation for the project/assignment 2. If you do not start the topic 8 practical, you might not finish assignment 2. You will have approximately two weeks to complete the assignment/project. The real work required for the assignment has already started in the lab work.

Once you have completed the above and submitted the required work, you are ready for the next topic.

If you have not understood something, make note of it to discuss during the workshop/lab class where you meet the lecturer/tutor.
