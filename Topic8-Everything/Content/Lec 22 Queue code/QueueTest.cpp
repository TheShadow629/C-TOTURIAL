// IntQueueTest Program
//
// Version
//   original by Nicola Ritter
//   modified by smr
// uses our own Queue class that encapsulates the STL queue.
// The client program should not take the implementation into
// account as that will create dependencies on how the Queue class
// is implemented. The client relies only on the public
// interface/specification of our Queue.

// This means that if the Queue class's internal data structure is
// changed to your Vector, this main (application) program should 
// not require change in code.
// To make sure, change the Queue to use your Vector and 
// build and run this application program.
//---------------------------------------------------------

// #include our own .h files first
#include "Queue.h"

// then #include the system files. Separate into two blocks.
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>
