You would have encountered some of the material in this set of slides
in your earlier units. But more "difficult" concepts are being 
introduced in this topic. It is insufficient to memorise them. You
will need to apply these concepts in code. The concepts apply to any
programming language you will use now or in the future.

We are using C++ but concepts would be in the first year Computer Systems unit
and the Foundations of Programming/Introduction to Computer Science units.

You *must complete Topic 1* before starting on this Topic.

Any lack of preparation in the early stages is going to cause you
severe problems in the later parts of the unit/module.
--------------------------
Step 1: 
Complete Topic 1 readings, lecture notes (3 .ppt files) and lab 1.
At least one of the slides is in Content/Homework..

Step 2:
For Topic 2, go through tutorials 8 to 20 of Bucky's tutorial. Use 
codeblocks and do the tutorials instead of just watching the video.

You would already know some of the material, so it would be good 
revision. If you can complete up to tutorial 26, you would be ahead 
and it will make your life easier for the more difficult topics 
coming up.

Step 3:
Read the textbook chapters -
- Chapters 4, 5, 
- Chapter(s) on User Defined Functions
- Chapter on Pointers, Classes, etc. See subsections on Pointer Data 
	Type and Pointer Variables; Address of operator; Dereferencing 
	operator. The reading of the chapter on Pointers.. can be done after step
	7 below.

Step 4:
Complete Exercises 1, 2 and 3 from LabExcTopic02 in the Practical Folder.

Exercise 1 will need to be submitted to access future topics.

For convenience exercise 1 is here. It is the specification of an ict159 assignment. It is revision for ict283 and would need to be submitted. A copy is in the folder Practical.

Be mindful of the advice given in the lab document. Exercise 1 has to be submitted
before you can access material from topic 3 onwards.

Step 5:
Where it hasn't been done earlier, complete the readings for Topic 2 summarised below.

The Content for Topic 2 includes "Video Lecture on Pointers". If you 
would like to, go through this after step 7 below. 

Textbook: 
Chapters 4, 5, and chapter(s) on User Defined Functions.

Textbook: Chapter on Pointers, Classes, etc. See subsections on Pointer Data Type and Pointer Variables; Address of operator; Dereferencing operator. Different editions of the textbook may have a different chapter number and pages. Use the title to match.

Reference text: 101 Coding Standards (can be completed after step 7)
https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.libproxy.murdoch.edu.au/lib/murdoch/detail.action?docID=5135988

+ Rule 51 Destructors, deallocation, and swap never fail.
+ Rule 52 Copy and destroy consistently

Please note that the importance of this reference text and the other
one, "Introduction to Algorithms" is so high that if there is any
conflict in advice or understanding, the material in the reference
texts would prevail.

Step 7:
Attempt Exercises 4 to 8 from LabExcTopic02 in the Practical Folder.

You do *not* need to understand all the code in DoxyExample yet. All 
you need to understand is how to write doxygen comments as shown in 
ModelFile.h and be able to express the design using UML with the starUML too.
Before using the starUML too, use pencil and paper to draw out diagram.

Doxygen comments go only in .h files. What are .h files for?

Step 8:
Prepare for later topics - 
See "Essential Reading List by Topics". It is found in LMS section on "Getting Started".

----------------
Complete anything that you were advised could be completed after step 7.
If you have completed these earlier, take the opportunity to revise them.
A good understanding of pointers is essential as you will not be able to 
complete future labs and the assignments without pointer programming skills.

Why is the RAII concept so important that you should *not* violate it?
