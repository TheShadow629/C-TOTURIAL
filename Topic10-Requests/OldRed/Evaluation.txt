Achieved:
This program can run as expected in case 1-6, for example: the output format, 
the average algorithme, the file of case4 can also be created normally, and the output 
is also in accordance with the format requirements, case1-4 already used the BST to 
store the data and output successfully. case5 use STL set to store the data and output
successfully. case6 can exit normally, the vector class can run normally, Tests can 
also be run. the rest class work well.
 
Not achieved:
without prepending m_ to global variables.
case5 the output of date format is a little bit wrong, the month is showing at the 
start. like 3(month)/11(day)/2014.
the specific time in case 5 didn't show.


Where to find:
Open the file named ‘ICT283A_Assignment1Demo_34073803_chenying_zhao’, for running this 
program, click ’AssignmentDemo1’, as you open this file, click the‘AssignmentDemo1.cbp’,
after entering the program, you can find the run button on the top, click run, the 
program will run.
How to use:
After running the program, users can enter number ‘1-6’ to try different case, enter 
‘1-3’, and follow the instruction pop on the screen, it will show the expected result. 
Enter ‘4’, and type the year from keyboard, you can find ‘WindTempSolar.csv’ under the 
‘data’ file, type'5', it will show the highest solar radiation, and the date.about ‘6’, 
it will exit the program.
Test plan: input the number 1-6, to check is the program worked.
And the test for vector, make sure work well.
output: the average value of specific data, find the matched csv file and exit 
successfully, and the vector class,stl map,and BST worked well.
