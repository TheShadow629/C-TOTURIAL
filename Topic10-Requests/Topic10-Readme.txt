Complete Topic 9, if not already completed, then go through the powerpoint files in Content.

The lab for topic 9 is assessed in class.


Step 1:
Go through any of Bucky's tutorials that you didn't complete

Use codeblocks and do the tutorials instead of just watching the video.

In a number of cases, you are being asked to view and do the tutorial 
more than once. If you have already understood, you can skip the 
particular video tutorial.

By now, you would have experienced that that everything is more complicated. 
So if you have skipped any work from before, go back and complete.


Step 2:
Go through the Content slides. 

Read the textbook chapters listed at the end of the slides - In a number of cases, you are being asked to read a particular chapter more than once because they are important. If you have already understood the chapter, you can skip.


Step 3:
Start on  LabExcTopic10 in the Practical Folder. This lab is is preparing you for the data structures code requirements of assignment 2. Follow the instructions given in the lab exercise. Data for assignment 2 is provided to you.

Be mindful of the advice given in the lab document. It is preparation 
for the project/assignment 2. 

Once you have completed the above, you are ready for the next topic.

If you have not understood something, make note of it to discuss during the 
class/clinic where you meet the lecturer.

Ask early. Aim to ask whatever you need to ask by the end of the second
last week of semester/trimester.
