// Shape.h
// An abstract base class for drawing shapes.
// Version
// 01 - Nicola Ritter
// 02 modified smr -
// to demonstrate dynamic polymorphism in C++
// Examine what is needed for this dynamic polymorphism to occur
// Use initilisation RAII principle
// Do not #include unnecessary files in the interface (.h) files
// Note advice about NOT having I/O in non-I/O specific classes.
// I/O  is application (MAIN) program's responsibility
// Identify all design issues and explain why these are issues

//#include <iostream> // is iostream needed here on in shape.cpp?
// DO NOT #include unnecessary interface files/headers

	virtual ~Shape () {};

		//For illustration only. Input is not normal behaviour for a Shape class, so having Input as a method stuffs up the OO design.
		// Set methods should be there instead.
		// Input method only to illustrate two virtual methods, one that is pure (=0) and the other that is not pure.
		// for polymorphism to occur, method needs to be virtual and the method needs to be accessed via a pointer ->
		// Input does not have =0 (not pure) so code body for Input is provided.
		virtual void Input ();

		//pure virtual. Pure (=0) means you can't create an object of Shape. There is no Shape::Draw() defined.
		//Virtual means that Draw can be polymorphic but needs to be accessed via the parent pointer, just like
		// Input() above.
