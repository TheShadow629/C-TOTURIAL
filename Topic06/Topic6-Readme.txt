You would have encountered some concepts in this set of slides in your earlier units and this unit. There is more new material including program code.

You must complete Topic 5 before starting on this Topic.

Any lack of preparation in the early stages is going to cause severe problems in the later parts of the unit/module.

Complete Topic 5 readings and you should complete exercises from LabExcTopic05. **Exercise 5 of lab 5 is part of assignment 1.** 


Step 1:
Read the textbook chapters - In a number of cases, you are being asked to read a particular chapter more than once because they are important. If you have already understood the chapter, you can skip.

o   Chapter on Classes and Data Abstractions
		You may have read this before in earlier topics. So treat this as revision.
		
o   Chapter on Inheritance and Composition, entire section on Inheritance up to but not including the short section on Composition

o   Chapter on Pointers, Classes, Virtual Functions, Abstract Classes, and Lists, start at section on Inheritance, Pointers and Virtual Functions

o   Chapter on Linked Lists

o   Chapter on Standard Template Library

o   Chapter on Arrays and Strings, sections on Parallel, Two- and Multidimensional Arrays

There is some reference material:
·  Reference book Introduction to Algorithms section on “Linked Lists” in the chapter on “Elementary Data Structures”

·  http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/ List of STL containers.


Step 2:
Review Bucky's tutorials https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAE85DE8440AA6B83
In particular, review 42, 49, 52 - 61. 

Use codeblocks and do the tutorials instead of just watching the video.

In a number of cases, you are being asked to view and do the tutorial more than once. If you have already understood, you can skip the particular video tutorial.

Note that things are getting a little complicated and if you are experiencing difficulties, please revise previous work and if you have skipped any work from before, go back and complete.


Step 3:
Review the three PowerPoint files in Content in Topic06 materials.

Study the code carefully in Lect16-Realisations when going through Lect-16.ppt. Understand how Polymorphism works.

Identify all design issues in the Realisations project.

UML Abstract Class shows that you can generate C++ (or Java or C#) code from UML class design.


Step 4:
Start on assignment 1 once it is available. As indicated earlier, question 5 from Lab 5 is part of assignment 1 and MUST be completed before the assignment is attempted. 

Assignment 1 includes question 5 of LabExcTopic05 with full documentation. So make sure you document all the classes you create (.h files) using doxygen in LabExcTopic05. 

The Vector class and question 5 in LabExcTopic05 is particularly important for the assignment. So make sure that the Date, Time and Template Vector classes are **fully tested and documented using doxygen and UML**. To do the assignment, you must be able to complete question 5 of lab 5.

Be mindful of the advice given in the lab document.

Once you have completed the above, you are ready for the assignment. 

Caution:
Assignment 1 involves reuse of modular design/code from Lab 5. Do not try to hack design/code to make assignment 1 work. You are not likely to meet the objectives and not even finish in the allocated time. Even if you somehow manage to get away with it, you will be get stuck in assignment 2 and very likely to fail the exam as your skill sets have not been built up to handle the exam. Failing the exam means failing the unit and you would have wasted your semester/trimester.

Take note of the QandA file for the assignment if it is visible. Check regularly. The QandA file for Lab 5 applies to assignment 1 as well.
