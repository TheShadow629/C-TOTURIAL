This is to demonstrate that staruml can generate code. A.h, A.cpp, B.h and B.cpp
are generated by staruml. 

testStarumlOutput contains a test program (.cpp file) with the main subroutine. 
The purpose is just to test if the output of staruml compiles and links. This test
program containing the main subroutine is not generated by staruml. 
Codeblocks has been used to create the executable.
**You have to write this test program yourself.**

If you want initial doxygen comments to be generated by staruml:

Make sure C++ profile is available. Model menu and then select profiles.
Include the C++ profile if not already included.

Then select tools menu and then options.
Select the C++ and then code generation option category

Scroll to File Header Comments Option Item.

To get the same output as the example in A.h and B.h

Copy and paste the following in the right column. Note that some of
lines have @@ instead of just @. This is because staruml treats some of
the @ codes with a special meaning and the @@ overrides this meaning.

It doesn't really matter if the comment output in the source is
generated incorrectly by staruml as you can always edit the comments
when you are programming. If you want to, you can specify the comments during
the generation process in the dialog window when generating. There is a tab at the
bottom in one of the stages of generation.
