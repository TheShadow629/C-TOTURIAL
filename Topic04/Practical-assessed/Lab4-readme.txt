Due at the next class. Work is assessed. 

Not completing this lab means that you 
would not be able to understand or follow the rest of the unit.
Consider withdrawing after consulting with the unit coordinator.
Check the HECS census date.


Read the QandA file when available.

Think very carefully about how you design the date class. The date class should be usable in other contexts. This means that it should be usable in other programs.

Design should be minimal and complete.
The interface should *not* be dependent on the implementation and the
user (client) of the class should *not* have to worry about how the date (or any other) class is implemented - should *not* have to worry about what is in the .cpp file. 

Please read the tip in the book Absolute C++ by Walter Savitch (Absolute C++. Pages 284-293). This tip is available from the ICT283 references in My unit readings. It is a digital file. 

Remember "high cohesion, low coupling".
See Rules 
 5. Give one entity one cohesive responsibility. 
 11. Hide information 
 42. Don’t give away your internals,
 43. Pimpl judiciously (referred to in Lec 12) - understand why needed.

Think carefully before you decide to use and discuss with your tutor first.

The ideas presented above don't just apply to C++. They apply more broadly to other programming languages and how problems get solved. Not all the languages you have studied so far provide the same facilities for abstraction as provided by C++ - i.e. the other languages may not provide operator overloading, but overloaded operators are just subroutines or methods with unusual names. So the concepts apply to anywhere you have methods.

Revise: The SOLID principles. A number of these have been covered.

Other advice:
If you are having problems understanding the work, please do not skip any lab classes. If you have attended classes and are still having problems, please email the unit coordinator (s.rai@murdoch.edu.au) indicating that you need help. You need to also join the PASS sessions.
