//  How to make friends and violate encapsulation
//  Rules for const parameter, const methods - experiment to find out - see comments in the code

 This is a demo program to experiment with concepts.
 This is NOT HOW YOU WILL WRITE CODE
//  When you write code, the specification and implementation would be
//   in separate files, and, you don't declare friendships easily.
//   The application program such as this one containing main() would be in
//   separate .cpp file.

//  3/2/18 added TRACE macro to trace source code lines in output
//  10/3/13 demo effects of const methods and parameters
//  24/02/13 created by smr  to show effect of friendship

// see https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Standard-Predefined-Macros.html for more symbols
// Used for debugging in output. Doesn't really replace the debugger that
// comes with the IDE. This TRACE is just for quick and dirty
// debugging in this unit. Tested in codeblocks. Drag/drop in codeblocks, build and run
// prints out the code line and then line is executed
