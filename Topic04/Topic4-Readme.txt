There is more new material now. 

This topic is not available unless the revision exercise has been submitted.

You must complete Topic 3 before starting on this Topic.

Any lack of preparation in the early stages is going to cause you severe problems in the later parts of the unit/module.

Step 1: 
Complete Topic 3. The lab work for Topic 3 needs to be completed as the topic 3 lab is reused in lab 4. Topic 4's lab builds on Topic 3's lab.

Step 2:
Read the textbook chapters -
- Chapters Searching and Sorting Algorithms. If your edition of the textbook doesn’t have this chapter, see the reference book “Introduction to Algorithms” chapter on Growth of Functions, section on O-notation.

- Chapter on Standard Template Library (STL)

- Go through chapter on Classes and Data Abstraction again. (very important as we will be needing this in the practical work later)

- Chapter on Pointers, Classes, Virtual Functions, Abstract Classes and Lists, section on Shallow versus Deep Copy and Pointers; section on Classes and Pointers: Some Peculiarities.

- Chapter on Overloading and Templates, all the sections till (and including) section on Function Overloading. If interested, read the templates section as well.


Step 3:
For Topic 4, go through tutorials
29,
46 to 51 of Bucky's tutorial. 

Use codeblocks and do the tutorials instead of just watching the video.

Step 4:
Go through the following "In Absolute C++ Pages 284-293" very carefully. 
https://rl.talis.com/3/murdoch/lists/8BACD9BC-76F5-29B7-02B2-DD63789ED257.html (log in). 

Know Information Hiding. See the Lab 4 readme file in "Practical-assessed".

Make sure that the page numbers that you are reading starts at 284 at the link above. 

If the link is not working or wrong page numbers are shown, contact the Murdoch University Library via "Ask a Librarian" at the bottom of the web page. 

You need to know about separation of interfaces from implementation and relate to the idea of Abstract Data Types. Do you need to know the implementation (bodies of methods) to be able to use the class? Explain if encapsulation has anything to do with the need for the separation. 

You need to know the difference between Structs and Classes. Note that a struct is used when aggregating data with no apparent behaviour.

A class is known by it's behaviour. The public methods define the behaviour.

After reading, answer the following:

- How would you explain the "principle of encapsulation"?
- How did you apply this principle to your own practical work?
- What is the essential difference between C++ structs and classes?
- Given what has to be learned thus far, when would you use a struct and when would you use the class encapsulation?


Step 5:
Go through the 3 PowerPoint files in Content for topic 4

Step 6:
Do Exercises 1 to 7 from LabExc-1-ass in the Practical Folder.
Be mindful of the advice given in the lab document.

Exercises 5 and 6 are assessed. UML is needed.

Go through the QandA any QandA file for the topic, if the file is visible.
